first think what you want your function to do and what you want it to return 

recursion is when same function needs to be repeated again and again in a loop, you can do it by a loop(usually for loop with if conditions) or recursion(by making function call itself) but in recursion you need to define exit conditions for the function so as to avoid reaching  maximum recursion depth 

#write your function thinking what you want it to do
in recursion the function must return itself except for the terminating condition of the function where it would return the output variable
#important to write return statement at correct place
