"""Is winning more important than peace for you

There are three ways to tackle things 
Wait for time, luck and god to solve it
Sit calmly, calculate and do as little or as much as you can do
Be desperate narrowing your vision, completion depends on the difficulty of the problem, not your desperation

Dopamine, excuses, amygdala, trivial stuff, unproductive habits are hard to refuse but it sees itself out if there's something more important than dopamine check if you have anything more important when you feel urge for dopamine (Marshmallow experiment)"""
