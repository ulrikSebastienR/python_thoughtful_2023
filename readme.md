> do grep -nr 'factorial' . to find file containing a specific program such as factorial in the current folder.

> #### programming tips
> - global to access variable outside scope of class and methods.
>- for recursion write first the terminating condition and then your simple function.
>- while loop can not update the iterator or i itself and we need to take care that new value of iterator is provided to the loop 

> #### organization
>- repeated attempts to alike programs are encapsulated in a class with wrong methods or attempts later in class methods
